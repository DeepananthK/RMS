# Resource Management System

## Task Scenario
Resource Management System helps to automate resource allocation process. The resources may be Lecture Halls, Seminar Halls, Laboratories or Conference Halls. Maintaining manual records for availability of resources is difficult. The person responsible for resource allocation may feel inconvenient. Resource Management System would reduce manual intervention in the process allocation of resources. People may need resources for Placement Activities, Guest Lectures, Workshops, Club Activities, Invente events and Cultural Practices. There may be some immediate need for resources, where the manual process of allocation may be time consuming. The user who needs a resource, goes to the webpage and Logs in. The list of available rooms along with their descriptions are displayed. The user will select a particular resource. If another user had already booked a particular resource on a particular day, then that corresponding resource would not be available for booking on that specified day. The user would check the availability and requests to book the necessary slot. The user needs to specify the reason for which he/she needs resource. The admin who is responsible for resource allocation, will get notified of the request and will either accept or decline the request. The admin can add or remove resources and can also lock a resource.
